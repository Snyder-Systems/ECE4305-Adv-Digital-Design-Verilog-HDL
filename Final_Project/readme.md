# Fall 2023 Final Project -Team DB
The final project we created is a very original game called "Flapping Bird". The objective of the game is to navigate a flapping bird using a joystick through pipes for as long as you can. The more pipes you navigate the bird through, the better your score.
The project utilizes the Sprite Core in our video controller to draw the bird and the pipes to certain positions on the monitor.
It utilizes the XADC Core to read in values from the joystick to control the birds position.
The OSD Core is used to display the title, current score, and previous score on the screen.
The PS2 Core is used to give keyboard controls to the game. The game can be paused, resumed, started, and  you can select the bird's color using the keyboard.
